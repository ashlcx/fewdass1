    <p>1 - 29 OCTOBER 2022</p>
    <h2>
      contour556 returns for The 4th edition this October - bigger and better
      than before.</h2>
    <p>The 2022 edition sees the festival rebranded as Canberra Art Biennial,
      and sees expansion to the National Arboretum (contour 656), the University
      of Canberra (contour 606) as well as maintaining and building further on
      our presence in North and South Canberra, centred on contour 556, the
      height above sea level of Lake Burley Griffin.
    </p>
    <p>Canberra Art Biennial extends across Canberra’s public spaces, and we are
      excited to partner with more private and public gallery / cultural spaces
      in inner north and south Canberra.
    </p>
    <p>Neil Hobbs is the creative director for the contour 556 and contour 656
      areas, with support from Heeseon Jung and the contour 556 board. The
      contour 606 satellite event will be co-curated by University of Canberra
      staff members Associate Professor Julian Raxworthy, discipline lead of the
      landscape architecture program and Ben Ennis-Butler, senior lecturer and
      Program Core Coordinator, Design.
    </p>
    <p>University of Canberra joins us as a major sponsor and supporter - The
      Faculty of Arts and Design students have revisited our logo and graphic
      branding, and we are delighted to have Julian and Ben contribute to the
      event.</p>
    <p>Artists will be responding to the designed city of Canberra: represented
      by Australia’s political, cultural and physical history. The event engages
      people of all ages and abilities, delighting, puzzling and encouraging
      interaction with art and public space.
    </p>
    <p class="footnote">The 2022 event is supported by sponsorship from the
      University of Canberra, Bonhams, KDN Group, Keir Foundation, numerous
      individual supporters through our crowdfunding pitches and the ACT
      Government.
